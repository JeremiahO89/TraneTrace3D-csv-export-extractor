Download Python 3.0 or newer from Google.

Put your ".csv" file in the same folder as the TrainConver.py file. The csv can either be a zone or room report from Trane Trace 3D
Right Click on the TrainConverter.py file and open with Python 3.0 (or whatever version of Python you downloaded).

A file named "Room Load Summary.csv" or "Zone Load Summery.csv" should appear in the folder with your original .csv file and python files, this new csv file is the cleaned data file.

You can now open this file with excel.
You're all done!


Warning!:
When you run the python script only one .csv file can be in the folder 
The name of the file does not matter but it needs to be a .csv type
If there is more than one .csv file the program does not know which one to open and it can/will mess up.
