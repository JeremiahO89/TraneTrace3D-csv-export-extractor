Go through the program after clicking run a file named "Room Load Summary.csv" or "Zone Load Summery.csv" should appear in the folder you choose.
You can now open this file with excel.
You're all done!


If you are noticing that the values in the cleaned file don't match what they should, open the keywords.csv file and look to see if the keyword in the first row matches the keyword in the trace csv file you want.
When trace does updates they can change the words in their export file. For example "Number of People" changed to “No People (max)” in one of the updates. If you notice that the keyword is different from the value you want, change that word and save the file. If there are other keywords you would like you can add them.
The second row is the header you would like for that keyword to map to in the new file, This most likely will not need to change but it's there for customization. These can’t be blank if you are adding new keywords to the file.  


If any other problems arise, send an email to jjo5541@psu.edu with the trace file you are trying to clean, and a zip of the Trace TrainConver program you are using.
