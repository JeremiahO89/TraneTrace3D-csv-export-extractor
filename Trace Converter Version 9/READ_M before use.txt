Double click on the Trane Trace Export Converter v1.0 file, and grant permission to run. 
Once opened select the .csv Trane Trace file you are trying to clean.
The Trane Trace file can be either a Room Summery, or a Zone Summery file.

Select a location to save the cleaned file too, the default is your Downloads folder.
Click run.
A file named "Room Load Summary.csv" or "Zone Load Summery.csv" should appear in the selected save location. 

You can now open this file with excel.
You're all done!

Additional Notes:
If you are noticing that the values in the cleaned file don't match what they should:
Click on the Keywords Page (at the top) and check that the "Words to search for:" row has keywrods that match the values you are searching for in the Trace.csv file.
When trace does updates they can change the words in their export files. For example "Number of People" changed to “No People (max)” in one of the updates. If you notice that the keyword is different from the value you want, change that word and save the file. 
If there are other keywords you would like to clean, you can add them or remove them. 
MAKE SURE TO SAVE before running after making any changes.
The second row ("Map words to label:") is the header you would like for that keyword to map to in the new file. These CAN NOT be blank or identical.

Other notes:
The keywords.csv file must be in the same folder as the Trance Trace Program.exe file. this is where the keywords are stored for future use. You can also edit the keywords here with excel instead of using the Keywords page.


If any other problems arise, send an email to jjo5541@psu.edu with the trace file you are trying to clean, a zip of the Trace Trace Export Coverter program with the keywords.csv file you are using.
